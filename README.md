Space Dodger Console Game




A "Space Dodger" console game is typically a simple, classic arcade-style game where you control a spaceship to avoid asteroids and obstacles, often inspired by Asteroids, built using programming libraries like Python's curses for a text-based environment. While there are many mobile games with similar names (like Space Dodger X on iOS or Space Dodger on Android), the "console" version refers to a foundational programming project demonstrating core mechanics like movement, collision detection, scoring, and increasing difficulty, as seen in AI-assisted development or basic JavaScript examples. 
Core Gameplay & Features
Objective: Navigate a ship through asteroid fields, collecting items (coins, power-ups) and surviving.
Controls: Usually simple (e.g., tap to change direction, arrow keys for movement).
Mechanics: Avoid blue asteroids, collect red/yellow ones to shrink or gain shields, earn points for distance/time.
Progression: Difficulty increases with speed and density of obstacles as you travel further.
Technology: Often built with Python (using curses) or JavaScript for accessibility.
